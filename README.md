Authen Digital is a two factor authentication (2FA) that provides the user with a touch-free authentication experience. 

Authen Digital’s 2FA is a patented technology that identifies and stores a representation of a user’s device in the cloud when a user’s device is registered, thereby whitelisting the device. 

At each login thereafter the user’s device is re-scanned (nothing is stored on a device), to grant or deny access to an account. The verification process at each login is performed without intrusion or awareness by the user providing a touch-free authentication solution. There is no need for tokens, SMS or inputs from the user.

Authen Digital® can be integrated into any apps for iOS, macOS, Android or Windows. For any other scenario, a solution can be developed using our SDKs (I.e. as browser extensions or more complex situations like VPN access (e.g. Cisco AnyConnect) or to protect server SSH access.

Authen Digital provides the administrative tools https://apps.apple.com/app/id1508944861  needed to manage users’ device authentications. Note that Authen Digital can be installed for one user and one device or as many as needed. At the discretion of an administrator from an authenticated device, new devices can be inserted, removed or disabled. With Authen Digital’s Developer Tools, a device manager section can be built for users giving them the ability to manage their devices, or in high risk environments, the management can be restricted to administrators only.

To easily demonstrate how it works, we have created a simple App that emulates a user account in which Authen Digital 2FA can be enabled to protect the account access. With Device Authentication enabled the account will only be accessible by the registered device. No tokens. No SMS. No codes. And If you try to access from any device that is not registered, the access will just be denied. This is a proof of concept of the how easily and securely Authen Digital touch-free authentication works with no user interaction compared with normal 2FA out there today.
